## Project Description
The Ecommerce Follow-Along Project is designed to help developers learn the core concepts of full-stack web development by building a complete E-Commerce Application. This project will guide you through the process of creating a fully functional application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), which is a powerful and widely used set of technologies for building dynamic and scalable web applications.

## What is MERN Stack?
The MERN stack is a collection of JavaScript technologies that allow developers to write both client-side and server-side code in JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the technologies involved:

1. MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, allowing for scalable and easy-to-manage databases.
2. Express.js: A lightweight web framework for Node.js that simplifies building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
3. React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic UIs efficiently.
4. Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development. By the end of the project, you'll have a clear understanding of how the backend and frontend components interact, how to design and implement RESTful APIs, how to manage data with MongoDB, and how to authenticate users securely.


## Milestone 1: Project Overview

This project will incorporate the following key features:

1. REST API Creation

    Learn how to build scalable and secure RESTful APIs to handle various functionalities, including user authentication, product management, and order handling.
    Each API will follow the standard principles of REST and provide endpoints that interact with the MongoDB database.

2. Authentication

    Implement secure user authentication using technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    Features will include user registration and login, ensuring that only authenticated users can access sensitive application features.

3. Database Schema Design

    Design and create structured MongoDB schemas to store e-commerce data, including users, products, and orders.
    Ensure data is stored efficiently and can be easily queried to support the frontend application.

4. Backend Development

    Set up a robust backend using Node.js and Express.js.
    Implement server-side logic to handle API requests, manage user sessions, and interact with the database.

5. Frontend Development (React.js)

    The frontend will be built using React.js to ensure dynamic and responsive UI.
    You will be responsible for creating user interfaces that interact with the backend through API calls.

## Key Takeaways
By the end of this project, you will:
1. Have a working knowledge of how to build a full-stack MERN application from scratch.
2. Understand how to manage user authentication, product management, and order handling using RESTful APIs.
3. Be proficient in building scalable and secure backend services with Node.js and Express.js.
4. Be able to design and manage databases using MongoDB and create efficient, structured schemas.
5. Have a complete e-commerce application that you can showcase as part of your portfolio.
